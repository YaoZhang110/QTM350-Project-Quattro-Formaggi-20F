# Amazon Rekognition Emotion Detection With Face Covered
1. Valid Values of Rekognition Emotion Detection: HAPPY | SAD | ANGRY | CONFUSED | DISGUSTED | SURPRISED | CALM | UNKNOWN | FEAR
Test each emotion with at least one pair of images of the same person with and without the mask using Amazion Rekognition
Possibly: let a volunteer who has not seen the image of the person with mask before to tell the emotion. Can the humans detect the emotion with mask?  
2. Cover the eyes instead of the lower part of the face (using ps maybe) and test again
3. Change the area of the face covered and test again, run regression if possible
